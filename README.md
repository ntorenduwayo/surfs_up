## Overview of the analysis

I would like to relocate to Oahu in Hawaii and open a Surf n’ Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, and tourists.  However, I don’t have enough money to get started, I have an investor who would like to back up my business venture, but he has asked me to investigate more about the island’s weather to make sure there are no surprises which may hamper the business.<br/>
The investor has provided me with Oahu’s weather dataset. I will use my expertise with SQLite (i.e., A version of SQL that lives on computer or phone, so is smaller, faster and doesn't have users), and SQLAlchemy (i.e., A query tool designed for SQLite and the integration of statistical analysis with data frame analysis) to analyze this dataset.<br/>
The analysis results will assist me and the financier to refine our venture and avert any shortcoming in our investment due to weather.
